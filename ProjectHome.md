On this space I share the code and technical details of my electronics projects.

## EbikeSmartController project ##
An Open Source EBike Smart Controller for bicycles with Smart capabilities and hackable/configurable options for advanced users, with wireless (Bluetooth) communication with Android Smartphones.

## SmartScale project ##
**An Open Source bathroom scale with bluetooth communication to Android Smart Phones.**

I hacked a cheap bathroom scale(20€) and added to it Bluetooth communications(55€) so I can track my weight on my Android Smart Phone.

I also hacked [Weight Chart](http://code.google.com/p/weight-chart/) Open Source software on Android and added the functionality for receiving the weight data coming from the bathroom scale.
First working version finished on February.2012.

## [3DPrinterEMCRepStrap](3DPrinterEMCRepStrap.md) project ##
This is my first 3D printer, where I use my CNC and a thermoplastic extruder. The project is based on [RepRap project](http://www.reprap.org/).
First working version finished on December.2009.

## SdCardBathroomScale project ##
On this project I hacked a digital bathroom scale, for write (log) my weight variations over time, on a memory SD Card. I write the information (time + weight) on a comma separated values (CSV) file (weight.csv) so I can build a graph using OpenOffice, GnuPlot or another capable program.
First working version finished on August.2009.

## PedalPowerMeter project ##
First working version finished on Jun.2009.
