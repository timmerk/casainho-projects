# Introduction #

**Smart Weight Chart** Android software helps you tracking your weight by logging it and show in a graph. It also communicate wireless with the [Smart Scale](http://code.google.com/p/casainho-projects/wiki/SmartScale) (Open Source bathroom scale) so it automatically logs the weight value or you can simple enter it manually.

[Smart Weight Chart is available here on Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=net.casainho.smartweightchart) - it's Free and Open Source.

In future I would like to continue develop Smart Weight Chart. I would prefer to do it in group with other developers and/or users - if you are motivated, contact me on the **[discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/smart_scale_weight_chart)** (preferable) or by e-mail: casainho@gmail.com
