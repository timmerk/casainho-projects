= Introduction =

On this project I will hack a digital bathroom scale, for log my weight variations over time, on a memory SD Card. I want write the information on a comma separated values (CSV) file so then I can build a graph using OpenOffice.

Source code plus pictures of current work can be found on [http://code.google.com/p/casainho-projects/source/browse/trunk/sdcard_bathroom_scale/ SVN].

== The scale ==

== The prototype ==

[http://a2.video3.blip.tv/0110000929915/Jpcasainho-sdcad_weight_scale20090718ogm635.ogg Video showing the last advances] -- now the system can show the weight as if it is the original scale.

== Digital Scale LCD signals ==

Here is one image of a backplane signal plus 2 segment signals:

== Fat file system drivers ==

I will use [http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html FatFs] file system drivers which have a Free Software license.
