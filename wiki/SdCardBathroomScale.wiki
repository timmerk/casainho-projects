*2012 January*

I am now near 100kg :-( I really need to go down on that value...

On this days I use my Android Smartphone a lot and I always wanted to have the weight data on the Android instead on the SDCard on the scale.

I went to the market and found "wifi" scales for about 150€. Since I will probably need to use the scale all over my life, I prefer to build my own OpenSource scale instead of buying and stay limited with a proprietary one.

I have now experience with Android and cheap ($6) bluetooth serial modules and I found two OpenSource softwares for Android for logging user's weight: [http://code.google.com/p/weight-chart/ Weight Chart] and [http://code.google.com/p/droidweight/ Droid Weight].

I decided to change/upgrade my Fagor BB-90 bathroom scale, by removing the SDCard and the batteries for the Real Time Clock (RTC). I added a cheap ($6) bluetooth serial module to send the weight value data to my Android Smart Phone. I also added a 5V voltage regulator since I am now using only two Lithium batteries instead of the "old" four NiMh batteries.

Here some pictures (high resolution [https://github.com/casainho/Smart-Scale/tree/master/pictures here]):

[https://github.com/casainho/Smart-Scale/raw/master/pictures/smart_scale-04.redimensionado.jpg]

Later I hacked the [http://code.google.com/p/weight-chart/ Weight Chart] software on Android and added the functionality for receiving the weight data coming from the scale, show it and finally save it.

I shared the software and the firmware on my github account: [https://github.com/casainho/Smart-Scale]

I also found a [http://www.keyboardmods.com/2010/05/bluetooth-wireless-bathroom-scale-with.html blog message of a hacker that decided as me, to use a bluetooth module and an Android]. The big difference is that he only uses the original load cells, then he uses and ADC to read them and almost the same hardware as me.

Maybe soon we will be able to buy on the market the load cells, make our electronic board and use a square piece of wood, then we will have our own fully OpenSource bathroom scale :-)

*2010.03.17*

On 2010.03.17 I bought on local Decatlhon shop the [http://www.beurer.com/ Beurer BG 16] bathroom scale for 20€ that measures weight, percentage of fat, percentage of water and percentage of muscle.

I hope to hack this scale and do the same as I did for the others ;-)

On this project I hacked a digital bathroom scale, for write (log) my weight variations over time, on a memory SD Card. I write the information (time date + weight) on a comma separated values (.CSV) file so I can quickly build a graph using OpenOffice, Gnuplot or some other capable program.

If anyone want to build a scale like this one, I can help, my e-mail is: casainho@gmail.com. I can also build a personalized system, please contact me for price and details. I would like to see this project grow, I would like to be able to buy on the market an Open Hardware and Open Source scale like this one - please contact me if you ave any ideas.

Here is a picture of me using the scale:

==Observations and things to improve==
The system works perfectly. Although there are some things I would like to improve:

 * The size of the characters on LCD are very small for this application, since my eyes are far from it when I am weighting myself. Maybe I can find another LCD?

 * Me and my girlfriend, we both need to lost weight, we both use the scale. Luckily our weight values are very different and I can differ them on system and have 2 different files on SD Card to register our weights separately. I would prefer to have some way to identify each person, so more people could use the scale if needed;

===Ideas for a future version===
I would like to have the bathroom scale sending by wireless the weight values. On a display console (running embedded GNU/linux) attached to bathroom wall, the wireless signal would be received and a graph would be shown to user with the last values of the last 2 weeks - on this way the user can have a clear picture of his weight progression.

The display console would also be able to store the time date and weight values on a memory SD Card or any other media.

The display console could also have a way to identify different users, maybe by using a biometric finger print (USB mouser with fingerprint ?).

= Technical details -- Scale Fagor BB-90 =
==The original cheap scale I bought on market== 
I bought the cheapest digital bathroom scale I could found on market, it were 20€, Fagor model BB-90. Other scales just looks the same, because they have the same number of LCD digits and the system appears to behave in the same way.

Picture:

[http://casainho-projects.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sdcard_bathroom_scale/images/bathroom_scale-fagor_bb_90/sdcard_bathroom_scale-20090703-01.jpg]

==How to get the weight value==
First I thought that I could read the sensors and got an analog voltage relative to weight but I couldn't find a way to do it. Next a friend at work give me the idea to try read the signals that went to original LCD, and it was a simple and easy way to have what I need :-)

The original LCD have 15 pins, 3 backplanes and 12 segments. I did understand how the LCD signals works reading this [http://casainho-projects.googlecode.com/svn-history/r71/trunk/sdcard_bathroom_scale/docs/lcd-an0162.pdf application note].

The segments signals have voltage that can be read directly by the LPC2103. The backplanes signals can't be ready directly by the LPC2103 (I think) and then I made a very simple voltage detector using a LM258 opamp so I get a "trigger" signal every time the backplane signal get near is maximum value. Since all the signals are sequential and have the same period of time, I just look for one backplane signal (just one voltage detector circuit with the LM258 opamp).

The next 2 pictures shows a backplane signal and 2 segments signals.

The next picture shows a backplane signal and a "trigger" signal I got using an LM258 opamp working as a comparator, like a signal value detector.

[http://casainho-projects.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sdcard_bathroom_scale/images/bathroom_scale-fagor_bb_90/osci_image-20090615-01.jpg]

===Understanding the logic of each signal=== 
After I saw on oscilloscope each signal that went to the original LCD, I quickly understand that 3 were backplanes and 12 were segments, because backplanes have always the same shape while the others varies with the segments on/off, with the weight value.

I had to understand which segments were turned on/off to represent each number on the original LCD, and not having the original LCD working any more, I had to make some tests to figure the information I were looking for.

I decided to write on LCD module HD44780 the state of each segment (synchronized with each backplane signal) and then try a few different known weight, so I had a known digits:

{{{
             0.0 kg

          backplane a:   0 0 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 1 1 . 0 1 1

          backplane b:   0 0 0 . 0 0 0 . 1 0 1 . 1 0 1

          backplane c:   0 0 0 . 1 0 0 . 0 1 1 . 1 1 1

--------------------------------------------------

             1xx.x kg

          backplane a:   0 0 1 . x x x . x x x . x x x
                                               
          backplane b:   0 0 1 . x x x . x x x . x x x

          backplane c:   0 0 0 . x x x . x x x . x x x

--------------------------------------------------

             2x.x kg

          backplane a:   0 0 0 . 0 1 1 . x x x . x x x

          backplane b:   0 0 0 . 0 1 0 . x x x . x x x

          backplane c:   0 0 0 . 1 1 1 . x x x . x x x

--------------------------------------------------

             6x.x kg

          backplane a:   0 0 0 . 0 1 0 . x x x . x x x

          backplane b:   0 0 0 . 1 1 1 . x x x . x x x

          backplane c:   0 0 0 . 1 1 1 . x x x . x x x
}}}

After reading about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display 7 segments displays on wikipedia], turned out in my head that the segments are:

{{{            
               a          y a b   <-- backplane a
             f   b        f g c   <-- backplane b
               g          z e d   <-- backplane c
             e   c
               d
}}}

Example of number 6, all segments turned on except segment b.:

{{{
             6x.x kg

          backplane a:   0 0 0 . 0 1 0 . x x x . x x x

          backplane b:   0 0 0 . 1 1 1 . x x x . x x x

          backplane c:   0 0 0 . 1 1 1 . x x x . x x x
                  
               a          y a b   <-- backplane a
             f   b        f g c   <-- backplane b
               g          z e d   <-- backplane c
             e   c
               d
}}}

==Selection of microcontroller==
Arduino/Atmel AVR, or ARM? - I really like Arduino, mainly because it's Open Hardware/Firmware and there is a lot of Open Hardware modules for it. I prefer to use ARM instead of Arduino/AVR because I have the same Free Software tools PLUS cheap, Open JTAG debugger! I don't really like the fact that Atmel have a closed, proprietary, debugger.

I am being using ARM7 LPC2103 which is the cheaper on this times and have all the functionalities and working power that I need. I decided to use Olimex dev. board [http://www.olimex.com/dev/lpc-h2103.html LPC-H2103].

==LCD module added==
I needed to use another LCD since I couldn't maintain the original one. I decided to try the cheap ones based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD44780_Character_LCD HD44780], since I have experience with them and I got some with me. Luckily, this LCD just enters perfect in the place of the original :-)

On the next picture we can see the LCD module and also the connections I made to original PCB using flat cable, on the pads that connected to original LCD.

==SD Card and FAT library==
I decide to use SD Card memory to hold the data because I had good experiences in past with this kind of memory card, using SPI BUS. Also I can find relative cheap cards easily.

My reference page about SD Cards is this one: [http://elm-chan.org/docs/mmc/mmc_e.html How to Use MMC/SDC by ChaN].

[http://casainho-projects.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sdcard_bathroom_scale/images/bathroom_scale-fagor_bb_90/20090817-sd_card.jpg]

=== Fat file system library===
I use [http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html FatFs by ChaN] file system drivers which have a Free Software license, are very complete and have good documentation.
===Data written to SD Card===
Here is some real data recorded on SD Card "weight.csv" file:
{{{
12-8-2009 23:48:28,"092,1"
12-8-2009 23:48:55,"092,3"
12-8-2009 23:57:46,"092,4"
12-8-2009 23:58:14,"092,0"
12-8-2009 23:58:40,"092,0"
12-8-2009 23:59:05,"092,0"
12-8-2009 23:59:44,"094,0"
13-8-2009 07:15:57,"091,5"
13-8-2009 07:36:54,"091,5"
13-8-2009 07:37:44,"091,5"
13-8-2009 20:15:02,"092,0"
13-8-2009 20:15:28,"091,9"
13-8-2009 21:22:53,"091,6"
}}}

==Real Time Clock==
Since I want to also register the time date, I need to have a Real Time Clock(RTC). LPC2103 have one RTC and the board I am using, have the RTC working.

Since I need to setup the clock with correct time date and I do not want to add buttons to the system just for doing it. I implemented the following idea: Every time that system boots, if on root of SD Card there is a file called "time.txt", read the time data from it and setup the clock; finally, delete the file.
 
The time.txt file should have a string with the following format (without square brackets):
{{{
[year][month][month day][week day][hour][minutes][seconds]
Example: [2009][08][01][6][12][00][00]; string "200908016120000".
}}}

I am using 2 X AAA NiMh low discharge batteries to power the RTC, I hope it lasts at least 1 year.

==Power down the system== 
After finish the prototype, I verified that the LPC2103 board + LCD module HD44780 were using about 140mA.

I worked to found a way to disable the circuit when the original scale circuits are not working. I verified that when original scale is off, there is no signals to the original LCD. I ended up by using a mosfet that is turned on when there a signal on the backplane 1 line.

I also control that mosfet with a signal from the LPC2103, so the system can keep with power turned on and shut off himself when desired.

= Technical details -- Scale Jata Hogar 490 =

I bought another bathroom scale. The model is "Jata Hogar 490", looks like it is from a [http://www.jata.es/ Spanish company].

== Status ==

Working correctly as on 2009.10.05. Firmware Open Source code is on [http://code.google.com/p/casainho-projects/source/browse/ SVN].

== Some pictures from original scale ==

== Technical explanation of the hack ==
I will just document the differences from the other [http://code.google.com/p/casainho-projects/wiki/SdCardBathroomScale first bathroom scale I did hack], all the rest is equal. 

I am using the ADC on LPC2103 for be able to read and sync with the LCD signals. Since the LPC2103 don't have 13 ADC channels, I used an external analog multiplexer of 16 channels, the 74HC4067 IC.

There is 13 pins that connects on the original LCD. There is 4 backplanes signals, which are the pins 10, 11, 12 and 13. Each other pins holds 4 bits.

Pin 1 holds bit data for kg and lb symbols. Pin 2 and 3 holds bit data for most significant digit of weight value. Pin 8 and 9 holds bit data for least significant (decimal) digit of weight value.

== Oscilloscope images from the pins that connects to original LCD ==

Each one of the following 13 images, shows the signal at each pin, when the scale starts and shows 0.0 kg on LCD. First image shows the signal at line 1 and last image shows the signal at line 13.

The blue line is a signal I used to trigger the oscilloscope. I got that trigger signal as a reference for the first backplane signal (line 10).

Here is the sequence of bits on pin signals and the correspondence to the segments on the LCD:
{{{
Pin 1 of 2: degf
Pin 2 of 2: xcba

             a
           f   b
             g
           e   c
             d   x

Examples:
                  degfxcba
Number 0: 11010111
Number 9: 10110111
Number 6: 11110101
Number 2: 11100011
Number 1: 00000110
