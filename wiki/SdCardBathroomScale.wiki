#summary Digital bathroom scale which logs weight and data on SD Card
#labels Featured

= Introduction =

On this project I hacked a digital bathroom scale, for write (log) my weight variations over time, on a memory SD Card. I write the information on a comma separated values (CSV) file (weight.csv) so I can build a graph using OpenOffice.

*[http://blip.tv/file/get/Jpcasainho-SDCardBathroomScale20090814820.ogg See this video]* that shows the scale working. Here is a picture of a graph made using the data written on "weight.csv" file:

Firmware source code, schematics sources and pictures of current work can be found on [http://code.google.com/p/casainho-projects/source/browse/trunk/sdcard_bathroom_scale/ SVN].

== Digital Scale LCD signals ==
The next 2 pictures shows a backplane signal and 2 segments signals.

The next picture shows a backplane signal and a digital signal used to sync system to the signals. I got that sync signal using an LM258 opamp working as a comparator, like a signal value detector.
